# Git feedback

## The Good

* very useful topic, especially for people working on programming.
* very useful specially when collaborating with others.
* "Great session"
* I have learned a basic background about git to know where I should
  start to learn.
* The Git Code Connectivity[?] is a gret tool.
* It is clear and the purpose was simple & extremely important. Also,
  the helpers were experts.
* Great introduction to Git. I appreciate the the time is limited 
  but it would have been nice to have a little bit on branches
* Very useful for organising research and data files
* Learned New material and it's all good. Although it's somehow difficult
  How to integrate it with gnerytray's[?] research Acivities
* Very helpful staff
* Excellent. Very useful info.
* Excellent, very useful
* Helpful infornation. Very good helpers.
* v. interesting to learn another way to collaborate on documents
  (other than google) :) The guys that are supporting us make a
  huge difference to the flow of the workshop (but where are the 
  girls today?)
* The introduction and the use of github
* Good to learn interaction with partner/collaborators on GitHub
* The lecture is very useful and clearly structured. Thanks! The
  staff working around are ver helpful and knowledgable. Thanks.
* Good instruction. Good delay btn instruction and coding.
* Great help and support in course
* Things are helpful.
* Very straightfoward. Happy with the pace. Tip: type/copy the 
  code into etherpad so we can go back if missed.

## The bad


* the course was a bit fast paced. Also people are not familiar with
  the comments so, when you type sth please don't cover it up with 
  other windows.
* This session was on fast track. Pace of delivery should be slightly
  slow :)
* The git course wasn't performed simultaneously with us. It was too
  fast.
* Nothing, just thanks!
* "Could have been great if the example using "real code" like 
   merging[?] a [sic] already writtn function or code
* I find it difficult to get my way around the collaborative work and
  merger
* The application of Git and GitHub are not clear.To me, it looks, it
  adds another layer of Complexity which is hard to justify.
* Difficult to follow and try to reproduce the results simultaneously
* No complaints
* Print out some commands to help understand the exercises. Prepare
  more clear examples for future trainings on git.
* Was too fast ti get
* sometimes it was too quick and hard to keep track (for somebeody 
  that is a bit lost from the beginning)
* The lst group practice should be more breakdown into
  - adding one line from both contributor[s]
  - then overap and see the change
* It was too fast to follow each step while applying by myself
* Improve preparation of content for limited time.
